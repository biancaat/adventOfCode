## About

This repository contains a selection of the Advent of Code challenges from 2021-2022. It is my first time experiencing the Advent of Code. I chose questions that reflect my abilities and provide a range of difficulties. 

I made an effort to add comments in order to reflect my thought process. 

## Lessons Learned:

I'm a big fan of the Advent of Code as an interview take-home challenge!
